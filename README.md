# neo-text-editor
Vim-like terminal text editor

This is my first proper project in C. In this project, I am trying to build a terminal text editor much like Vim or Neovim.
I called it Neo because I aim for it to have workflow and different text editing modes like Neovim without the Vim-specific
shortcuts. I want to incorporate general shortcuts like ctrl-C, ctrl-X, ctrl-V and ctrl-S (copy, cut, paste, save) into the
editing process instead of having to learn new shortcut specific to Vim like y, yy, p, w.

I will still try to maintain most of the features and functionalities of Vim but... I am not smart. I am building everything
from scratch to challenge myself and grow... but you have to understand I'm working with C here. I might just end up making 
something with less functionality than Vi. I pray that won't happen.

I'm using https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html as reference. If it gets to hard, I'll just copy their code :D
I'm kidding ofc... or am I? `\(*_*)/`
